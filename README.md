# Design discussions for elm-review

`elm-review` is a project spanning multiple repositories. It can be a bit difficult to propose improvements or new features to the project, especially when the feature spans multiple parts (Elm package, CLI, editors...).

The issues in the individual repositories will focus on bugs (and/or rule ideas for review packages), and this repository will gather more general feedback, feature and evolution proposals, as well as explorations and research (around static analysis or even comparisons with similar tools).

If you're interested in Elm or static analysis, please watch the repository and pitch in! :pray:

Note that if you want to propose a rule idea, [`elm-review-rule-ideas`](https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review-rule-ideas) is the place for that.
